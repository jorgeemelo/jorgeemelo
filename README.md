Technology has been following me without rest for a while now. I've been studying about Hardware I.T since 8-9yo, did some courses as a teenager, worked a little here and there, developed some bot applications for Tibia (a MMORPG) as a 16yo curious using PHP, but the real kick only came after Journalism college. I was/am working with finances and, somehow, I found a Dutch guy with a trading robot that needed some attention and that drove me back to developing. Since then, I can't help the feeling of building something, or testing something, or researching about something that cares about technology, development and the future of things — which we are certainly building.

My utility belt:
    - Python
    - Javascript
    - Typescript


- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting better and better at developing fully functional web pages from scratch/design.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects and Open Data providers. If you want to display Data in a simple and understandable way, count me in.
